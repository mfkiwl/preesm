Performance.Chart.description=This chart gives an idea of the possible speed-ups and compares them to the achieved speed-up. The ideal speed-up is equal to the number of processors as long as it does not exceed the work length divided by the span length. The work is the sum of all actor times and the span is the length (in time) of the longest sequential path in the DAG. Here, the span corresponds to a deployment of the algorithm on an architecture with an infinite number of homogeneous operators with the main operator type. The characteristic values for the current implementation are:
